>Vim is a text editor for Unix that comes with Linux, BSD, and macOS. It is known to be fast and powerful, partly because it is a small program that can run in a terminal (although it has a graphical interface)
>It is mainly because it can be managed entirely without menus or a mouse with a keyboard
